# Multilayer Perceptron
This project is a simple multi-layer perceptron created using NumPy. I started this project towards the end of highschool and continued adding to it throughout my first year in college (this is why it may not have the most optimal design).

I have mainly used this project to grow my understanding on neural networks and the specific math that makes them function. I have created neural networks from this MLP framework and trained them on the MNIST dataset using backprop. I have also created a Flappy Bird clone and trained the birds in the game through neuro-evolution using this project.
